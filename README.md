# AutoScale Script

## Overview
A Unity C# script that smoothly scales a GameObject up and down continuously.

## How It Works
- Adjusts `localScale` every frame for smooth resizing.
- Reverses direction every 2 seconds using a timer and `scaleSign`.

## Usage
1. Attach the script to a 3D GameObject.
2. Adjust `scaleFactor` and `duration` as needed.
3. Press Play to see the effect.

## Customization
- Modify `scaleFactor` for speed.
- Change `duration` for timing.
